# DenoisingAutoencoderN-MNIST
This repository contains the code for the project Denoising Autoencoder for the Noisy-MNIST Dataset. 

This project was a part of the coursework for 'Machine Learning', taught by Dr. Venkateswaran at Department of ECE at SSN College of Engineering

The code contains a Denoising Autoencoder trained on two datasets, the original Noisy-MNIST Dataset and a manually created dataset by adding AWGN, MotionBlur and Reduced Contrast on normal MNIST dataset.
